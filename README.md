“GeeseSpotter” is a simple, text-based, single-player game.

The player is first asked for the desired dimensions of the 2-dimensional playing board and then for the number of geese that should hide on the playing board. The playing board is made up of individual fields. A field can be occupied by a goose or not. Geese are messy, and the (up to) eight neighboring fields of a field that contains a goose contain goose droppings. An observant Waterloovian can tell how many geese are in neighboring fields by observing the amount of goose droppings.
